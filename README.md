# ImageEffects

This is a Xamarin.iOS binding project that adds the methods for the `ImageEffects` category provided by Apple during the WWDC2013 for blurring images. 

# Getting Started

There is an example project that demonstrates how to use the extension methods. The basic usage allows you to call the extension methods like this:

``` cs
// Apply the blur effect
newBGImage = newBGImage.ApplyLightEffect ();
```
